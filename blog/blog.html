                    var, let, and const are keywords used for declaring variables in JavaScript, and their scope
                    determines where the variable can be accessed and manipulated within our code.
                    <br><br><b>var:</b>

                    Variables declared with var are function-scoped. They are accessible within the function where they
                    are defined, but not outside of it.
                    <br><br><b>let:</b>
                    let are block-scoped. They are accessible within the block (e.g., a loop or conditional statement)
                    where they are defined.
                    <br><br><b>const:</b>
                    Variables declared with const are also block-scoped, just like let.const variables cannot be
                    reassigned once they are assigned a value.

                    <b>Default Value:</b> Variables that are declared but not initialized are automatically assigned the
                    value
                    undefined.
                    <br>
                    <b>Function Return Value:</b> If a function does not explicitly return a value, it implicitly
                    returns
                    undefined.
                    <br>
                    <b>Property Access:</b> If you attempt to access an object property that doesn't exist, it returns
                    undefined.
                    <br>
                    <b>Function Parameters:</b> If a function is called with fewer arguments than declared parameters,
                    the
                    missing parameters are undefined.
                    <br>
                    <b>Variable Scope: </b>Variables declared without a value initialization are initially undefined.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u><i>Null:</i></u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    <B>Explicit Absence of Value: </B>null is a value that represents the explicit absence of any object
                    value
                    or no value.
                    <br>
                    <b>Typically Set by Developers: </b>Unlike undefined, null is typically assigned by a developer to
                    indicate
                    that a variable or object property intentionally has no value or is empty.
                    <br>
                    <b> Useful for Clearing References:</b> It can be used to clear a reference to an object, indicating
                    that it
                    should no longer be used.

                    REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an
                    architectural style for designing networked applications. REST is not a protocol but a set of
                    constraints and principles that provide a lightweight and scalable approach to designing web
                    services.
                    RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on
                    resources. 
                    <br><b>The commonly used HTTP methods include:</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>GET:</b> Retrieve data (Read).
                    <br>
                    <b>POST:</b> Create new data (Create).
                    <br>
                    <b>PUT:</b> Update existing data (Update).
                    <br>
